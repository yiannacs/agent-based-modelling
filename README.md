# Minority Strategies

_This code was written as part as a team project for the Agent-Based Modelling module of the Computational Finance MSc program at King's College London._

Inspired by a gap in agent-based modelling research of minority influence, we built on Muthukrisna and Schaller’s (2020) model and expanded on the dynamics it simulates, going beyond social network influence. By introducing activist agents with attributes that define their messaging, we aimed to model Moscovici’s (1980) findings on the effects of rigid or flexible, and consistent or inconsistent minorities.
